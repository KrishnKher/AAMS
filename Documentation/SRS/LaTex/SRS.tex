\chapter{Overall description}
\section{Product Perspective}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=white, colback=lightblue, arc=8pt]
    The “Seat Allotment Portal” software is aimed for IITH faculty to sort the candidates based on a sorting criteria efficiently and to reduce the manual component involved with the traditional method significantly. 
    SAP should be an easy-to-use, highly reliable software capable of offering a lot of flexibility to the user(s). SAP is intended to be a stand-alone software, independent of the availability of other software. 
    SAP is platform independent, i.e, it should run on Linux, UNIX and Windows based platforms. 
\end{tcolorbox}

\section{Product Functions}
\begin{figure}[h!]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/table.png}
\end{figure}
\section{Product Planning}
Agile methodology will be adopted to ensure the maximum client satisfaction as well as continuous delivery of working code after every few sprints. Code practices that facilitate continuous feedback from the users will be always strived for. This may include changing certain details in the present SRS document, but the barebone structure will remain invariant.
\section{User Characteristics}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The intended user is a person empowered by IITH with the academic powers authorized to shortlist students based on various criteria e.g. faculty member of IITH.
    \item The user should be familiar with the rules needed for shortlisting. 
    \item Familiarly with basic handling of Microsoft Excel/Google sheets is desirable.
\end{itemize}
\section{Principal Actors}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \texttt{\textbf{\textcolor{TealBlue}{User}}}.
        \item \texttt{\textbf{\textcolor{TealBlue}{System}}}.
    \end{itemize}
\section{General Constraints}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Should output results with 100\% accuracy.
    \item It should be efficiently scalable in the number of students being shortlisted.
    \item Tool/application should be OS-independent.
    \item Requires Internet connection for it to work fully.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Assumptions \& Dependencies}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Certain features require Internet connectivity.
    \item Takes input data only in the form of Microsoft Excel /Google sheets/csv files.
    \item $100$\% accuracy on results guaranteed only when data is $100$\% clean.
    \item The user uploads the correct .csv file containing the candidates data in Round $1$.

\end{enumerate}
\section{Design Constraints}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Security}}: \begin{enumerate}
        \item The user information (username and password) should be encrypted and stored in the server. 
        \item The data that would be uploaded to SAP should be protected from being accessed by external applications that are already present in the user system.

        \item The SAP server should be able to serve a large number of users simultaneously ($\approx 1000$ users).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Fault tolerance}}: \begin{enumerate}
        \item Data should not become corrupted in case of a system crash or a power failure.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{\textit{Integrity}}: \begin{enumerate}

    \item Once the user has logged in securely, a window is opened with a sidebar that has the option to create new projects or manage existing ones.
    \item In each project, $10$ rounds can be accessed. A particular round can only be accessed once the previous round is done.
    \item In Round $1$, two csv files must be uploaded to get that round offers, namely the seat matrix csv and candidate data csv. Once the candidate data csv is uploaded, there is a window to preview the csv data. A sort button is also present, which sorts the data based on entered priorities.
    \item Once the sort button is clicked, there is a pop-up that is generated that has the option to add priorities for sorting, for example which column has what priority and even the order to sort in (such as ascending or descending). Then these priorities are saved.
    \item The sorted candidate data can be previewed in the window again. Once this is done, we can download the offers in the format required by CoAP.
    \item In the subsequent rounds, the updated seat matrix and CoAP response .csv files should be uploaded to download that round’s offer.
\end{enumerate}
\chapter{Future Extensions}
\begin{tcolorbox}[colframe=white, colback=lightgreen, arc=8pt]
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Tool should be able to show various statistics about how many offers are in the accept-and-freeze mode/reject-and-wait, etc., which will give the department/institute an idea of the trend across various iterations of the CoAP process. 
    \item Enable the tool to be able to directly send the processed shortlists directly to CoAP.
    \item Handling concurrent transactions across devices for a user.
    \item Tool should support shortlisting based on custom-defined rules that the user can define using a specific protocol rather than just those based on the CoAP shortlisting rule.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Suggest any inconsistencies that might be present in the custom-defined rules.
    \item A further extension would be to enable the user to define the rules in plain English and use NLP to infer the rules being requested for.
\end{itemize}
    \item Enable multilingual data to be input in the data sheets.
    \item Integrate accessibility features into the tool, such as a voice assistant.
    \item Automatic validation of category certificates using state-of-the-art image captioning  techniques.
\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Appendix}
\section{Appendix A: Sorting procedure used by the portal}\label{Appendix A}
The sorting procedure used by the portal is flexible and allows the sorting method to be declared by the user, i.e. it allows the user to decide which columns (criteria) should be used to sort the students as well as what ranking to follow with respect to the criteria (selected columns). This allows the user to modify the sorting procedure before the CoAP process starts.
\section{Appendix B: Seat Matrix declaration and modification
}\label{Appendix B}
The seat matrix initial declaration involves either uploading a .csv containing the seat matrix statistics, i.e. the specialization, number of seats, seat type etc., or entering the seat matrix through our portal's input interface.
The seat matrix modification involves changing the statistics of the initially declared statistics i.e. increasing the seats of a specialization. We don't allow for a decrease in the seat count during the modification procedure.
These two procedures together give the user flexibility, which involves accommodating for introduction of new specialization during any given year as well as accommodating seat count changes due to any other action.
\section{Appendix C: User Interface}\label{Appendix C}
The description here comes in a sequel to the External Interface Requirements (\ref{EIR}) described above.
